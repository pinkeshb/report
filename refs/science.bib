abstract = "In this paper, we suggest an efficient method for solving Fredholm integral equations of the first kind. The continuous Legendre multi-wavelets constructed on [0,&#xa0;1] are utilized as a basis in Galerkin method to reduce the solution of linear integral equations to a system of algebraic equations. Illustrative examples are included to demonstrate the efficiency and the application of the technique. "
