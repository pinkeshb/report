A new framework has been devised to design a class of time-frequency localization optimized, orthogonal wavelet filter banks. Three design problems are proposed to design the optimal orthogonal filter banks. Semidefinite programming (SDP) is used to solve the three design problems. An analysis low-pass filter is first designed and the impulse response of the other members of the filter bank is computed employing the quadrature conjugate symmetry (CQ). The time-frequency localization based optimality criterion is used to design the filter bank. The objective function taken in Design Problem 1 is the convex combination of the time variance and the frequency variance (CCTFV) of the impulse response of the analysis low-pass filter, which is minimized subjected to double shift orthogonality and vanishing moment constraints. In Design Problem 2, the time variance of the analysis filter is minimized after fixing the frequency variance to a constant value, whereas in Design Problem 3, the frequency variance is minimized after fixing the time variance to a constant value. A few design examples for three design problems are discussed in the report.
