\chapter{\label{ch:wavelets}Wavelets}
Wavelet constitute a family of functions constructed from dilation and translation of a single function called the mother wavelet. When the dilation parameter a and the translation parameter b vary continuously, we have the following family of continuous wavelets as [Boggess]\\

$\psi_{a,b}(x) = {|a|}^{-1} \psi(\frac {t-b}{a})
,   \hspace{0.2cm} a,b \in R, a \neq 0.
$\\

If we restrict the parameters $a$ and $b$ to the discrete values as $a = a_0 ^-k, \\b = n b_0 a_0^{-k}$, where $a>1,b>0$ and $n$, and $k$ are positive integers, we have the following of discrete wavelets:\\

$\psi_n,k(x) = |a|^\frac{k}{2} \psi(a_0^k t - nb_0)$ ,\\
 which from a wavelet basis for $L^2(R)$. In particular, when $a_0 = 2$ and $b_0 = 1$ then $\psi_n,k (x)$ forms an orthonormal basis [Boggess].
